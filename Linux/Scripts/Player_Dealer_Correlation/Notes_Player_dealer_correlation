A total of 14 losses occured on the 10/3, 12/3 and 15/3 on the following hours at the roulettee table

- 8am, 2pm, 8pm and 11pm on the 10th
- 5am, 8am, 2pm, 8pm and 11pm on the 12th
- 5am, 8am and 2pm on the 15

two individuals are placed commonly working and playing at each one of those times; Billy Jones the primary dealer working at the rouletee table and Mylie Schmidt a guest betting at the table.

judging by the data viewed with the player win/loss data and the dealer schedule Mylie Schmidt would only ever bet while Billy was playing which seems extremely suspicous and i beileve that they are participating a scam together.
